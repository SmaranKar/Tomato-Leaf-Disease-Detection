# Tomato-Leaf-Disease-Detection
 Tomato leaf diseases can cause significant crop losses, so early detection and treatment are essential. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been shown to be effective for image classification tasks, including tomato leaf disease detection.  
 
 In this project, I developed a custom CNN model to detect tomato leaf diseases. The model was trained on a dataset of 10,000 images with 10 classes (healthy, early blight, late blight, bacterial spot, leaf mold, yellow leaf curl, septoria leaf spot, two-spotted spider mite, mosaic virus, and target spot).The model achieved a training accuracy of 99%, validation accuracy of 90%, and testing accuracy of 86%. These results demonstrate that the model is effective at detecting tomato leaf diseases.


Potential applications:

a) The model could be used to develop a mobile app for farmers to use to detect tomato leaf diseases in the field.

b) The model could be used to develop a system for automated tomato leaf disease detection in greenhouses and other agricultural settings.
